# Compare-Grade

The program goes through a folder containing user folders looking for a C file in each one. 

When the file is found he is compiled, run and compared to the wanted output then graded.

The program that compares the outputs is also written and returns 3,2,1 if the files are identical, similar or different (respectively). 

Two files will be considered similar if they contain the same text with different spacing, line dropping and/or upper/lower letters.
